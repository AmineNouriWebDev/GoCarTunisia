            of the Lessor.<br />
            <br />
            Any harmful consequences resulting from driving the vehicle outside
            the declared area will be entirely at the Lessee’s expense, and the

            vehicle's immobilization costs. The repair costs will be payable
            upon estimate. It should be noted that the Lessor will immediately
